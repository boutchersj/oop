let dog = {
  name: "Spot",
  numLegs: 4,
  sayLegs: function() {return "This dog has " + this.numLegs + " legs.";}
};

dog.sayLegs();

//The 'this' keyword is a complex topic, but above is an example of a simple use of it

//'this' in the context of the 'sayLegs' method refers to the object the property/method is associated with

//That lets us remove the 'dog' name reference from the method and makes the code more reusable

//It protects us from the object's name changing, since 'this' refers to the object regardless of name
