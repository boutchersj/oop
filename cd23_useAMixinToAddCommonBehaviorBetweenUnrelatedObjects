//Mixins are functions that give properties to whatever objects are passed to them
//Here we make a 'glide' mixin that lets you give a 'glide' property to any object passed to it
//These are a useful alternative to inheritance, especially for giving unrelated objects the same property
//This way also reduces code compared to setting the property manually in multiple objects
