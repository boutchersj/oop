function Bird() {

//This is a more secure way of declaring a weight property inside of a constructor
//The weight value can't be modified outside of the function, and is read-only via the '.getWeight()' method
/*The principle that allows the method privileged access to the 'weight' variable 
because it was declared in its same context is called 'closure' */
