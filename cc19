function Animal() { }

Animal.prototype = {
  constructor: Animal,
  eat: function() {
    console.log("nom nom nom");
  }
};

function Dog() { }

// Add your code below this line
Dog.prototype = Object.create(Animal.prototype);

let beagle = new Dog();
beagle.eat();  // Should print "nom nom nom"

//Setting a constructor's prototype equal to the supertype's prototype is how you get it to inherit all its properties from the supertype
//So every instance of Dog() now has the '.eat()' method inherited from Animal()
//Notice how the Dog() constructor has zero code in it, yet still contains information because of inheritance
