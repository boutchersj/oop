//When a constructor inherits its prototype from its supertype, it ALSO inherits the supertype's constructor property!
//This must be manually reset to a different value if we want the constructor of the subtype to be unique 
//Above, we reset Bird's constructor property (currently Animal) to Bird. It still inherits everything from Animal because of the other code
